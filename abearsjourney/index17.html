I mean, thank you for all of your wisdom, but I have so much to think about! Oh, and it’s so late, I need to get home!” He ran out of the house, his furry little arms raised to shield him from the wind, or perhaps to hide some tiny bear tears in his eyes.  #52

<img class="bearframe" src="images/story/053.jpg" /><br /><div class="bearcaption">That night, the bear was haunted by troubled dreams, despite wearing his warmest, comfiest pajamas. He dreamt he was trapped inside a raindrop (or was it a teardrop?) with only a handful of glowing stars to keep him company. Whenever one would come close, and he would reach out to hold it, it would slide away from his paw and back into the darkness.  #53
